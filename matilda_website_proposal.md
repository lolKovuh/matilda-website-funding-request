## üê± Proposal

Requesting **2 billion QUBIC** to the address  
**JICUNOMUXDPNPGBVDQAQVEKVNBRCKZMDCPHMXZSWTGOVATZLCZSMVXMBZPCM**  
in order to fund a complete revamp of the **Satoshi‚Äôs Cat ($MATILDA)** website.

---

## Overview

We are requesting funding to completely revamp the website for **Satoshi‚Äôs Cat ($MATILDA).**

As the first animal-themed memecoin on Qubic ‚Äî and one that symbolically references its founder through his real-life cat ‚Äî $MATILDA naturally serves as an obvious beta play for newcomers.

A revamped site with personality, clean design, and well-curated content would elevate first impressions. It would serve as an engaging gateway to Qubic, drawing visitors into the CFB = Satoshi theory ‚Äî a path that, regardless of the truth, highlights Sergey Ivancheglo‚Äôs verified achievements and role in pioneering the crypto industry.

### By funding a high-quality redesign of the $MATILDA site, we aim to:

- **Attract newcomers** to Qubic through a theory that sparks curiosity and naturally draws them in ‚Äî increasing the likelihood of turning passive investors into active, engaged community members.  
- **Develop a visually stunning, high-quality site** that convincingly presents the CFB = Satoshi theory while simultaneously showcasing Sergey Ivancheglo‚Äôs verified achievements in the crypto space.  
- **Strengthen the overall optics of Qubic** by elevating one of its most recognizable meme tokens.

## Rationale for Funding Request

Although $MATILDA has a designated marketing wallet, we are intentionally not using it for this initiative due to the relatively low market capitalization.

Given $MATILDA‚Äôs high growth potential, selling $2,000‚Äì$3,000 worth of tokens at the current market cap of $300k‚Äì$400k would be shortsighted. It would also reduce the wallet‚Äôs capacity to support future high-impact marketing efforts.

By securing external funding of **2 billion QUBIC**, we can develop a high-quality, engaging website that elevates both Qubic and $MATILDA‚Äôs optics as it serves as a compelling gateway for newcomers to the Qubic ecosystem. This strategy preserves the marketing wallet for future opportunities when token sales will have minimal impact on market dynamics.
